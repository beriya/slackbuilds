# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libsass: LibSass - Sass compiler written in C++
libsass:
libsass: LibSass is just a library! If you want to use LibSass to compile 
libsass: Sass, you need an implementer. Some implementations are only bindings
libsass: into other programming languages. But most also ship with a command
libsass: line interface (CLI) you can use directly. There is also SassC, which
libsass: is the official lightweight CLI tool built by the same people as
libsass: LibSass.
